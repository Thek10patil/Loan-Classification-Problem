# Loan Classification Problem

### - Problem is about prediction of whether user is applicable to get a loan or not.
### - Implemented differnt classifier algorithms. Checked accuracy of those classifier using Analytics Vidhya solution checker.

## Implemented Voting Classifier

##### The idea behind the VotingClassifier is to combine conceptually different machine learning classifiers and use a majority vote or the average predicted probabilities (soft vote) to predict the class labels. Such a classifier can be useful for a set of equally well performing model in order to balance out their individual weaknesses.
